# JobApplicationTrackingApp

This project goal is to track your job application. With this app you can easily see in which company you applied and track if they answered you or not.

The project was developped using React for the front and Spring Boot for the back.

It really helped me to learned Spring Boot main concepts and to improve my react skills.

I planned on adding a login system and to host the app.
